                    <p>
                        Based on John Conway’s Game of Life, this project is a simulation of a grid of cells that evolve,
                        reproduce, and die based on certain rules.
                        <br><br>
                        To incorporate what I've learned in my Foundations of Biology elective,  I modified the original
                        rules of the simulation to account for lifespan and decay over time. Each cell is assigned a
                        value that decreases each step of the simulation, as if getting closer to the end of its life
                        expectancy.
                        <br><br>
                        This model can take many different configurations of my rules, which in turn affect the patterns
                        that can be observed.
                        <br><br>
                        In the future, I anticipate using this model as a basis for a multi-player game where the goal
                        is to “devour” the other player’s cells or “conquer” the entire board.

                    <p>
                        Tiny Shadows is a 2D, local 2-player platformer game around 10 minutes long, developed for the 2023
                        GameMaker's Toolkit Game Jam. I chose to create it with the Godot 4 engine due to the engine's
                        beginner-friendly and through documentation.
                        <br><br>
                        This project was inspired by other pixel art platformers such as Celete. I decided to make this
                        a two-player game to my interpretation of the theme "Switching Roles," as the two players will
                        have to take turns pushing levers, pressing buttons, and platforming to help each other through
                        the five levels.
                        <br><br>
                        As this was a solo project, my responsibilities covered game & art design, animation, and
                        core gameplay development. Since this was my first experience with Godot 4 and with game
                        development in general, this was a very challenging process. Fortunately, I was able to find
                        many good resources to ease the difficulty.
                        <br><br>
                        A feature I would love to highlight is the multi-target camera used in this game, which allows
                        for both players to always remain on-screen without the use of split-screen through dynamic
                        zooming. It achieves this through frame-by-frame linear interpolation of all its targets.

                        huddleUp is a social media platform designed for college students to easily find and join social
                        events on campus. It allows users to make accounts, post events, and sign up for activities.
                        <br><br>
                        This platform was made during the 2023 SteelHacks Hacakthon using Python and Flask with a SQL
                        database of users. I worked on this project with a team of four and I was mainly in charge of
                        the backend. The features I was responsible for include joining events and tracking the users
                        involved in each event, post tagging and filtering, and post updates and deletions.
                        <br><br>
                        At the time, our team did not have a lot of experience working on full-stack projects. As a
                        result, we decided to use Flask for our project for the ease of setup, and a simple SQL schema.

                        creates key cards for the user. It was created as a solo project for the SheInnovates 2023
                        Hackathon as a study tool for students.
                        <br><br>
                        KeyFinder uses the <a href="">ChatGPT API</a> to identify keywords in the text. Then, it

                        keyword within the context of the text. It was originally tested on passages from my roommate’s
                        biology textbook; however, it can also be prompted to read from literary texts or articles,
                        making it widely applicable.

                        My biggest challenge with this project was with the frontend. I had little experience working

                        RiotCreche is a machine learning model that aims to predict a game outcome given two League of
                        Legends team compositions.
                        <br><br>
                        The dataset used in this project was webscraped from game analytics site <a href="">OP.GG</a>.
                        It includes the team compositions and results of the last 20 games of each of the top 100
                        worldwide players at the time. After cleaning the data, this model builds a random-forest
                        classifier to predict a game outcome. Factors such as a character's role, position, and
                        counterpicks were taken into account.
                        <br><br>
                        This model is not very accurate as League of Legends has a constantly changing meta and varying
                        factors beyond team composition. But, it was a fun exercise for me nonetheless and allowed me to
                        practice manipulating data, working with large datasets, and using Python frameworks for game
                        data analytics.

                    development, data analysis, data validation, and SQL database management.
                    This experience provided me with a good overview of how large-scale
                    data is leverged within internal operations of a major manufacturer.
                    <br><br>
                    Most of my work involved the development of Tableau applications
                    tailored to assist various teams within U.S. Steel
                    through data visualization and in-depth analysis. One notable
                    project involved creating a dynamic dashboard that showed the
                    movement and spend of a specific product inventory.
                    This involved showing trends that automatically update each
                    month.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I had the opportunity to collaborate closely
                    with the U.S. Steel Data Science team on projects that
                    center around the development of Python web applications
                    designed to handle the loading and cleaning of bulk data
                    from the company's datalake.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the key takeaways from this internship the importance
                    of understanding and visualizing data in an industrial setting.
                    The applications I helped create were critical in helping
                    teams make informed decisions and optimizing internal processes.
                    Being able to practically apply my programming skills to achieve
                    demostratable impact was an incredibly rewarding experience.
                    <br><br>
                    The exposure to Tableau, Python, and SQL has equipped me with
                    valuable skills and insights I am eager to take into my next role.

                <h1>Trend Micro</h1>
                <h2>IT CX Intern</h2>
                <h3>June 2022 - August 2022</h3>
                <p>
                    During my internship at Trend Micro, I worked with the UX
                    team to reduce churn and enhance our customers' experiences
                    with our full suite of cybersecurity solutions. My primary
                    responsibilities centered around improving our customer onboarding
                    process - a pivotal step to effective customer retention.
                    <br><br>
                    The focus of our team was twofold. Firstly, we aimed to create
                    a streamlined onboarding process for new customers, ensuring a
                    seamless transition into the utilization of Trend Micro's
                    products. This involved identifying pain points in the
                    onboarding journey and implementing solutions to enhance the
                    overall customer experience. Secondly, we conducted targeted
                    outreach to existing customers whose data indicated
                    underutilization or deployment challenges with our products.
                    <br><br>
                    Through in-depth data analysis of over 500 customer accounts,
                    my team and I improved the accuracy of our customer reports and
                    identified areas within customers' infrastructures where they were
                    underutilizing Trend's products. Using this data, we then implemented a hands-on
                    strategy to help clients follow our best practices. Old clients
                    were shown the value of staying with our suite of products, while new
                    customers were given a good first impression.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the key highlights of my internship was collaborating with many
                    different teams within Trend Micro, from client-facing teams to engineers.
                    This multifaceted approach allowed me to not only understand the
                    technical aspects of cybersecurity but also appreciate the importance of effective
                    communication and collaboration across different teams within the organization.
                    <br><br>
                    Through this internship, I got an in-depth look at the cybersecurity
                    industry and best practices, honed my data analysis skills, and developed
                    a comprehensive understanding of customer experience management.
